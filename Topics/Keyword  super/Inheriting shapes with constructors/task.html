<h2>Inheriting shapes with constructors</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>Create a base class called Shape with a constructor that takes the shape's name as a parameter. Then create a derived class called Rectangle that inherits from Shape and has a constructor that takes the shape's name, width, and height as parameters. The Rectangle constructor should call the base class constructor using the super keyword. Finally, create a Rectangle object and print out its name, width, and height.<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Square<br>5<br>5</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Name: Square<br>Width: 5<br>Height: 5</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>

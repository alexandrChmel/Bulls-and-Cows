<h2>Calculating package shipping cost by weight</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>Create a Java program that defines a class called 'Package' with a private member variable 'weight' of type double. The class should have a constructor that takes the weight as a parameter and a public method 'getShippingCost' that returns the shipping cost based on the package weight. The shipping cost is calculated as follows: $5 for packages weighing up to 5 pounds, and an additional $1 for each pound above 5 pounds. In the main method, create an instance of the 'Package' class with a weight entered by the user, and print the shipping cost.<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">3.5<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">5.0</code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">7.2<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">8.0</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
